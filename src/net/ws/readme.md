**WARNING: LEGACY VERSION**

NOTE: This is the 0.2.x version of WebSocket++. There some fairly significant 
API changes in 0.3.x so upgrading should be done carefully. Due to these 
changes, a snapshot of the last 0.2.x version will be tagged in the master 
branch and retained in the 0.2.x branch for any 0.2 user's convenience. The 
0.2.x branch may be updated if any particularly problematic issues are found.

The 0.3.x+ line is the preferred code for any new development. 0.3.x can be 
found in the 'Experimental' branch on GitHub. In the near future it will be 
promoted to the master branch.
